## Overview
The Docker volume plugin supports the below platforms and the corresponding drivers for those. The plugin supports all volume provisioning and managenment operations, defined by the Docker Volume plugin interface, on both platforms. Both drivers allow users to provision and use VMDK backed volumes for containers in Docker.

1. vSphere
2. Photon

## Docker vsphere volume driver
The Docker vsphere volume driver supports provisioning and managing docker volumes on a standalone or cluster of ESX servers via a service (ESX service) that's installed and runs on each server. Docker volumes are created and managed via publicly available VIM (Virtual Infrastructure Management) APIs on the ESX host.

## Docker photon volume driver
The Docker photon volume driver supports provisioning and managing docker volumes on a Photon platform consisting of a cluster of ESX hosts managed via a Photon controller instance. Docker volumes are created and managed entirely via the open Photon platform API via the Photon controller.

The Docker Volume plugin can support either or both types of volumes, as required, on a given Docker host.

## Configuring the Docker Volume Plugin
The docker volume plugin loads runtime options and values from a JSON configuration file (default `/etc/vsphere-storage-for-docker.conf` for Linux, `C:\ProgramData\vsphere-storage-for-docker\vsphere-storage-for-docker.conf` for Windows) on the host. The user can override the default configuration by providing a different configuration file, via the `--config` option, specifying the full path of the file. Options that are currently recognized include the below set. Options passed on the command line override those in the configuration file.

### Selecting the driver to handle volume operations
The docker volume plugin supports two drivers, namely, `photon` and `vsphere` for the Photon and vSphere platforms respectively. The `vsphere` driver was earlier named as `vmdk` and the plugin still supports both names. The `vmdk` driver name can be used in place of `vsphere` for now, but will be deprecated in a later release. The choice of driver is specified as below in the [sample configuration](#sample-plugin-configuration). The plugin uses `vsphere` as the default driver, which is overriden via the configuration file.

### Options for the photon volume driver
* Target    - URL at which to contact the Photon Controller
* Project   - project ID in Photon to which the docker host belongs
* Host      - ID of the docker host VM in Photon

### Options for logging
* LogLevel      - logging level for the plugin
* LogPath       - location where plugin log fils are created
* MaxLogSizeMb  - max. size of the plugin log file
* MaxLogAgeDays - number of days to retain plugin log files

## Sample plugin configuration
```
{
	"Driver": "<driver name - vsphere/vmdk/photon>",
	"MaxLogAgeDays": 28,
	"MaxLogSizeMb": 100,
	"LogPath": "/var/log/vsphere-storage-for-docker.log",
	"LogLevel": "info",
	"Target" : "http://<photon_controller_ip>:<target port>",
	"Project" : "<21-digit photon project ID>",
	"Host" : "<32-digit photon VM ID "
}
```
Note:

1. The current version of the Photon volume plugin doesn't support authentication as yet, this will be added up in a subsequent release.
2. The "target port" is set to "9000" if authentication isn't enabled in photon controller, else port "443" is used.
3. Both project and VM IDs mentioned above can be obtained via the "photon" CLI, see https://github.com/vmware/photon-controller/wiki/Compile-Photon-Controller-CLI.
