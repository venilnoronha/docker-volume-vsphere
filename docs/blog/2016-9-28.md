# 0.7 Release
We continue our monthly release cycle with our [September release](https://github.com/vmware/vsphere-storage-for-docker/releases/tag/0.7)

Thanks to [Bruno Moura's](https://github.com/brunotm) [work](https://github.com/vmware/vsphere-storage-for-docker/pull/597), Docker volume plugin for vSphere now supports selection of file system format when creating a new docker volume.

Ability to set a volume [read-only](https://github.com/vmware/vsphere-storage-for-docker/issues/274) is now supported by the plugin. The [admin cli](https://vmware.github.io/vsphere-storage-for-docker/user-guide/admin-cli/#set) allows the admin to set a volume to be read only.

# Coming up

One of the major features in the pipeline is multi-tenancy and vCenter integration. More about that soon..
