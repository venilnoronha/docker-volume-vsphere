# Use the following environment vars to change the behavior to build managed plugin:
#
# DOCKER_HUB_REPO - Dockerhub repo to use, in both name forming and in pushing to dockerhub.
#                   Defaults to the result of `whoami` command.
#                   Note: you first need to run 'docker login' in order for 'make push' to succeed
# VERSION_TAG     - How you want the version to look. Default is "current git tag +1 "
# EXTRA_TAG       - additional info you want in tag. Default is "-dev"
#
# To check resulting settings use  "make info"
# examples:
#   make
#          --> resulting name (for my build as of 3/17/17)  msterin/vsphere-storage-for-docker:0.13-dev
#
# 	DOCKER_HUB_REPO=vmware EXTRA_TAG= VERSION_TAG=latest make
#           --> resulting name vmware/vsphere-storage-for-docker:latest
#
#   DOCKER_HUB_REPO=cnastorage EXTRA_TAG=-CI make
#           --> resulting name cnastorage/docker-volume-vspehere:0.13-CI
